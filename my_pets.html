                <p>Moose is 1 and half years old. He can be a huge brat a lot of the time. But, he is a puppy though. He is a german Shepard Shiba Inu. His dad was a German Shepard, and his mom was a Shiba Inu. We got him when he was almost 2 months old. The week we got him was the last week of Febuary 2018.</p>
