                <p>Fortnite is pretty self explanatory because everyone has heard of it. It's a battle royale game that got released shortly after PUBG got released. It's a battle royale game, but with a twist. The twist is that you can build. Fortnite has came a long way because it's now in Chapter 2 Season 1. It has become a great game again since it 'reset'.</p>

                <p>I play Apex Legends every once and a while. But, not often. But, it's a fun game. It's a game like any other Battle Royale Game.</p>

                <p>I play Call of Duty a lot. I have Infinite Warfare, Modern Warfare Remastered, Black Ops 3, and Advanced Warfare. I mainly play Black Ops 3. But, I absolutely love Call of Duty. I've been playing this game since my dad got for the Nintendo Wii that my family used to have.</p>

                <p>I've been playing MC for years. Maybe since 2016. I stopped Playing it because I was 'Adicted' to it. I hadn't played it since January 1st, 2018. But, then my brother showed me mods on his game. And I started playing it again recently. I play it on my computer, and Xbox One. I used to play it on my phone as well. But, like I said, I had stopped playing it before.</p>
